Traject was born out of the Government’s R9Accelerator program, which is all about making it easier for people to interact with New Zealand Government.
We’re a group of people who are passionate about helping Government do this and we chose the simple form to demonstrate how thinking like a customer can guide the form design process to develop experiences that delight.


Working with Immigration New Zealand as our sponsor, Traject, a team of two, explored the opportunities of solving the tech sector skill shortage and making it easier for business to hire the talent they need. After a few pivots and diving into problem discovery, our team and company grew and we found our true calling: crafting purposeful and delightful forms to build more effective government services.
