# Traject Blog

Kia ora.


Traject crafts purposeful and delightful forms to enable effective government services.


A well designed form is like a fantastic ma√Ætre d'. It'll make you feel welcome, get to know you just enough to ensure you get exactly what you came for, and remember to return your jacket on the way out.


Our co-design process, field research expertise, and relentless focus on plain-language communication enables us to create compassionate and intelligent forms people actually enjoy using. As a bonus, great forms collect great information too. 


This saves time and paper on both sides for every government interaction, improves internal capabilities, and helps the government connect with the people that they serve.
